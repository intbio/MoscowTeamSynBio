Readme
Step 1 - ot this step we used the TemBERTure model in order to get thermophilicity score and melting temperature scores predictions. CSV files with sequences were used. 
As an outpoot files we got fasta-file for further step and csv-file with the results of the predictions 
Step 2 - at tis step we used TEmStaPro model in order to get additional stability scores at different temperatures. We used fasta-files from previous step as an input file. As an output we got tsv-file with predictions
Step 3 - at this step we combined data from both outpoot files from previous steps, added protein characteristics using BioPython an, trained the ExtraTreesClassifier model to predict the class of the sequence (0 - functional temperature < 70 °C, 1 - functional temperature > 70°C). Finally we predicted the class scores for experimental data ind got csv-file with final results.
