Fluorescence Prediction for GFP Mutants
Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting the fluorescence brightness of mutant GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) variants based on their amino acid sequences. The model uses protein sequence embeddings from esm2_t30_150M_UR50D and a custom ResNet-based architecture to achieve high-accuracy brightness predictions.

Key Features
✔ Sequence Processing Pipeline: Filters invalid mutations (*, .) and clusters sequences by brightness.
✔ ESM-2 Embeddings: Leverages state-of-the-art protein language models for feature extraction.
✔ Deep ResNet Model:

10 blocks with batch normalization, ReLU, and skip connections.

Trained with Adam optimizer (MAE loss, lr=2e-5).
✔ High Performance:

Test MAE = 0.11

Unbiased predictions (error peak at 0)

Correlation = 0.84 (predictions vs. true values)
